      <description>Business problem:
Credit card companies can detect fraudulent credit card transactions, preventing customers from being charged for products they did not purchase. Data Science and Machine Learning can be used to solve this type of problem. This project aims to demonstrate to build a best performing machine learning models to detect Credit Card Fraud.
Dataset:
The Dataset collected via Kaggle which covers credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.</description>
